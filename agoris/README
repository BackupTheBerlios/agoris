agoris README
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Agoris is a simple and free chess library. Even though it was designed to run
on Unix (-like) systems, it should compile just fine with any modern C++
compiler on any platform. It is written in C++ and allows you to base your own
chess games and front ends upon it. The library provides move generation, rule
checking and various search algorithms.

More than anything this code was written to explain how chess programs work
internally and also to demonstrate one possible way of implementing some
theories of board game programming. Good human players should be able to defeat
the strategies of Agoris (and so will strong computerized opponents, such as
KnightCap, Crafty or TSCP), but the focus of this work is on education rather
than complicated optimization.

Agoris is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. It was
written from scratch and is maintained by Andreas Bauer. For more information,
see the README and COPYING documents provided with the Agoris library.

ATTENTION!!   This is a development release of Agoris (see TODO). Do not expect
to have hours of challenging chess tournaments with this piece of software yet.
